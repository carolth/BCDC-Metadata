# C2M2 partial instance generation branch `c2m2_generation`

The sample manifest from 2020 Q2, together with project/data collection and other metadata, was used to generate some of the TSV files comprising a C2M2 Level 1 instance.

The following were not generated and are instead solicited from the archives:

1. data_type.tsv
2. file.tsv
3. file_describes_biosample.tsv
4. file_format.tsv
5. file_in_collection.tsv
