cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	TransgenicSTPT			Transgenic STPT	Transgenic Characterization - serial two-photon tomography	Transgene expression was used to label cell types and brain regions in mouse brain, and these transgenes were characterized using serial two-photon tomography to create 3D volumes. These data were used in conjunction with other multimodal reference data to parcellate the entire mouse brain into anatomic regions in order to create the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3), an annotated 3D reference space with 10Âµm voxel resolution.
cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	TransChar			Transgenic Char	Transgenic Characterization	Transgenic approaches are used to label neurons in a cell type specific manner in mice. These transgenic mice can be then be used to enable profiling of specific cell-types by various assays.

To determine the brain-wide targets of projection-defined cell types (e.g., caudoputamen-projecting amygdala neurons), Cre-dependent anterograde tracing was used. Cre was delivered to a projection-defined population of neurons, whose outputs were then traced via a Cre-dependent anterograde tracer injection. Utilizing this strategy, the unique brain-wide connections of different projection-defined neurons can be attained (e.g., targets of caudoputamen-projecting amygdala neurons versus targets of hippocampus-projecting amygdala neurons). Male C57BL wild type mice 8 weeks of age were used and all sections were counterstained with Nissl for cytoarchitectonic details

Retrograde pathway tracers identify the input connections of injected regions by labeling cell bodies. Male C57BL wild type mice 8 weeks of age were used. In one experiment, 3-5 retrograde tracers were injected in different regions of interest spanning the cortex, striatum, thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, midbrain, or hindbrain. As such in one experiment, four different populations of neurons were identified simultaneously. All sections were counterstained with Nissl for cytoarchitectonic details.
cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	dong_trio_proj			TRIO	Tracing the relationship between input and output (TRIO)	Different populations of neurons can be defined by their unique connectivity profiles. To determine the brain-wide inputs to projection-defined cell types (e.g., caudoputamen-projecting amygdala neurons), Cre-dependent rabies viral tracing was used. Cre was delivered to a projection-defined population of neurons, which received TVA and rabies glycoprotein delivered via a Cre-dependent helper virus. Next, an EnvA pseudotyped G-deleted rabies virus was delivered to the same population of neurons to label their monosynaptic inputs from cells across the brain (e.g., brain-wide inputs to caudoputamen-projecting amygdala neurons). Utilizing this strategy, the unique brain-wide monosynaptic inputs to different projection-defined cell types can be attained (e.g., inputs to caudoputamen-projecting amygdala neurons versus inputs to hippocampus-projecting amygdala neurons). Male C57BL wild type mice 8 weeks of age were used and all sections were counterstained with Nissl for cytoarchitectonic details.
cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	ecker_sn_ATACseq_proj			Chromatin accessibility	Chromatin accessibility profiling of genomic DNA in individual mouse brain cell nuclei (RS1.2)	The goal is to profile open chromatin at single cell resolution using snATAC-seq across >100 mouse brain regions. The resulting profiles will be used to both define cell types and generate comprehensive catalogs of regulatory elements for each cell type. The brains of adult male C57BL/6J mice (P56) were sliced into 18 600-micron-thick coronal sections and tissues isolated from selected regions in each slice were pooled separately (6-30 animals per region, hemispheres combined). Pooled nuclei were subjected to tagged Tn5 transposon insertion to identify accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq). (Note: The same tissue pools were used in both RS1.1 and RS1.2.) Over 100 selected brain regions were sampled across both brain hemispheres in male mice.

The brains of adult male C57BL/6J mice (P56) were sliced into 18 600-micron-thick coronal sections and tissues isolated from selected regions in each slice were pooled separately (6-30 animals per region, hemispheres combined). NeuN-positive and NeuN-negative cell nuclei were purified from each pool, and isolated nuclei subjected to single nuclei methyl-C DNA sequencing (snmC-seq2). (Note: The same tissue pools were used in both RS1.1 and RS1.2.) Over 100 selected brain regions were sampled across both brain hemispheres in male mice.
cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	ecker_sn_mCseq_retro_proj			Methylation projection neurons	Regional DNA methylation profiling of individual projection neurons isolated from the mouse brain (RS2.1)	The goal is to generate single nucleus methyl-C DNA sequence data from purified projection neurons from >100 neuronal circuits in the mouse brain. Recombinant AAV is injected bilaterally into selected brain regions in INTACT mice (B6.129-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm5(CAG-Sun1/sfGFP)Nat/MmbeJ animals in the C57BL/6 background, Jax stock #030952 @ two male and two female animals per injection site). Two weeks post AAV infection (P56), dissection of mouse brains follows the slice/region isolation protocol used in RS1. GFP-positive nuclei of projection neurons are isolated from the tissue segments pooled from selected anatomical regions that are known to project to the initial injection target, and subjected to single nuclei methyl-C DNA sequence analysis (snmC-seq2). Over 100 brain region pairings are analyzed from both male and female mice.
cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	ecker_trio_proj			TRIO tracing	Linking inputs to outputs of projection neurons within epigenetically defined regions in the mouse brain (RS2.2)	The goal is to link the epigenetic profiles of projection neurons to their monosynaptic inputs and distant outputs from >100 neuronal circuits in the mouse brain. TRIO experiments use 3 different viruses (AAVretro-Ef1a-Cre, AAV8-hSyn-FLEX- TVA-P2A-GFP-2A-oG helper virus, and EnvA pseudotyped G-deleted Rabies mCherry (EnvA RVdG-4mCherry). At the start of the experiment, AAVretro-Ef1a-Cre is injected unilaterally into structures that receive axons of target brain regions of interest. Two weeks post AAV infection (P70), injection of AAV helper virus and G-deleted rabies virus (AAV8hSyn-FLEX-TVA-P2A-GFP-2A-oG helper virus, EnvA RVdG-4mCherry) are made into the regions of interest. One week following the injection of AAV helper and rabies virus the brains are sectioned and imaged to visualize neuronal populations defined by their corresponding input and output profiles. The patterns of labeling across the whole brain are then reconstructed, quantified, and mapped to the Allen CCF and made available on www.mouseconnectome.org. This results in labeling, across the entire brain of neurons providing input to each projection cell type within epigenetically defined regions of interest. over 100 brain regions are analyzed for male mice.

CRE-driver lines targeting major cortical projection neuron subtypes and crossed to the Sun1-GFP nuclear reporter mouse line (C57 background) were used.

C57 wild-type mice at p60 were used. Dissections of frozen tissue were performed to obtain regions including neocortex, isocotex,substantia nigra, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, cerebellum and hippocampus.

cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	kriegstein_sc_10x_proj			10x 3' v2 sequencing	Single-Cell Sequencing of the Developing Human Brain	The human brain is composed of diverse cell types across brain regions that enable unique capabilities. Within the brain, the cerebral cortex is responsible for a number of cognitive functions and sensory integration, with distinct cortical regions controlling a variety of tasks including motion, vision, speech, and judgment. Recent work exploring the cell types of two distinct cortical regions in the human and mouse suggests that excitatory neurons are area specific and emerge during developmental stages of peak neurogenesis. However, further characterization of cortical arealization is required to understand whether gradients, sharp boundaries, or some combination of patterns describes the areal distribution of neurons and other cortical cell types. Importantly, accurate modeling of cortical development and understanding biological constraints for any attempts at stem cell therapies requires characterizing when neuroepithelia or radial glia transition from a uniform population into areal specific progenitors, and the degree to which they are committed to an areal fate. In order to comprehensively characterize the areal diversity of cell types during human development, we performed single-cell sequencing of a variety of cortical regions and sub-cortical structures from 20 intact first and second trimester brain samples. With over a million cells, we identify hundreds of cells types including temporal and area specific neurons, interneurons and radial glia populations, as well as a number of subtypes from each of these classes that are expressed across most cortical areas. Additionally, we find a small number of subpopulations of neuroepithelial cells and identify several key pathways that may regulate the switch from neuroepithelia to radial glia identity. Together, these datasets suggest a model of both area restricted progenitor populations as well as radial glia cell types that are observed across cortical regions, suggesting an orchestrated interplay of fate determination that gives rise to the required cell diversity of the human cerebral cortex.

cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	kriegstein_sc_ATACseq_proj			Single cell ATAC-seq	Single-Cell ATAC-seq of the Developing Human Brain	Dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility coincide with important aspects of neuronal differentiation, such as fate specification and arealization and confer cell type-specific associations to neurodevelopmental disorders. However, studies of the epigenomic landscape of the developing human brain have yet to be performed at single-cell resolution. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility of >75,000 cells from eight distinct areas of developing human forebrain using single cell ATAC-seq (scATACseq). We identified thousands of loci that undergo extensive cell type-specific changes in accessibility during corticogenesis. Chromatin state profiling also reveals novel distinctions between neural progenitor cells from different cortical areas not seen in transcriptomic profiles and suggests a role for retinoic acid signaling in cortical arealization. Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.
cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	kriegstein_sn_10x_proj			10x 3' v2 sequencing	Single-Nuclei Sequencing of Late Stages of Human Brain Development and Early Postnatal Life	Human cortical development spans years of prenatal and postnatal development. This incredibly complex process involves multiple interacting cell lineages and dynamic processes, such as neurogenesis and gliogenesis, neuronal migration, cell differentiation, areal specification, axon outgrowth and synapse formation and maturation. Human cortical development proceeds through a number of critical stages that are believed to be affected in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In order to investigate the dynamic landscape of human cortical development at the single-cell resolution, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile more than 100 post-mortem human cortical tissue samples from over 50 individuals and three cortical areas. We included samples ranging from second and third trimesters of prenatal development though neonatal and early postnatal stages to teenage and early adult years. By using unbiased nuclei isolation coupled with droplet-based single-cell profiling (10x Genomics), we generated over 300,000 single-nucleus transcriptomics profiles. We performed unbiased clustering, marker discovery and trajectory analysis, and were able to discover gene expression programs that underlie generation of subtypes of cortical projection neurons, interneurons and glial cell types, as well as critical process of development, such as generation of astrocytes, axon outgrowth, synapse formation and formation of mature cortical neuronal circuits. By intersecting cell type-specific developmental gene expression profiles with known genetic risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders, we were able to identify cell types and developmental stages that can be especially affected in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, leading to improper formation and function of specific cortical circuits. Our study sheds light on cell type-specific mechanisms of normal cortical development and cell types and processes affected in common neurodevelopmental disease. In addition, our rich single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas will be of great value to a wide range of neuroscientists.

The stereotyped distribution of brain cell types, their numbers and ratios in all anatomical regions, is a fundamental determinant of brain functions, yet classical stereological methods have been too laborious to allow comprehensive analyses across animals and genders. Here we apply our quantitative brainwide (qBrain) cell-type mapping platform, comprising cell-type labeling, single-cell resolution imaging by serial two-photon tomography (STPT), and automated computational analyses, to map the stereotyped distributions of over thirty neuronal and glia cell types in male and female mouse brain. We discover detailed organizing principles underlying known functions of sensory, motor and cognitive cortical circuitries, as well as over a dozen of sex-dimorphic cell-type distributions primarily in brain structures of the vomeronasal system regulating reproductive and social behaviors. The qBrain atlas provides a unique anatomical resource that can be mined to link stereotyped aspects of neuronal distributions to known and unknown functions of diverse brain areas.

cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	yang_MORF_confocal_proj			Dendritome mapping	Dendritome mapping of genetically-defined and sparsely-labeled cortical and striatal projection neurons	Integrating molecular, morphological, and connectomic properties is critical for unbiased classification of neuronal cell types in the mammalian brain. Here we propose a novel approach to classify neuronal cell types by brainwide comprehensive profiling of the dendritic morphology of genetically-defined neurons in the mouse brain. We have developed an innovative mouse genetic tool, called Mosaicism with Repeat Frameshift (or MORF), which enables sparsely and stochastically labeling of genetically-defined neurons in mice. MORF reporter mice can label in exquisite detail single neurons from dendrite and spines to axons and axonal terminals at a labeling frequency of 1-5% of a given neuronal population. We propose to cross our new MORF lines with Cre mouse lines for striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of direct- and indirect pathways, and for cortical pyramidal neurons of distinct cortical layers (i.e. L2/3/4, L5 and L6). Each MORF/Cre mouse will allow us to image the detailed dendritic morphology for thousands of genetically-defined striatal and cortical neurons (i.e. dendritome). We have also developed and streamlined imaging and computational tools to acquire and register brainwide single neuron morphological data onto a standard reference mouse brain atlas. We will digitally reconstruct hundreds of thousands of MORF-labeled neurons using our novel program called G-Cut. Reconstructed neurons will subsequently used for morphology based clustering to define new morphological subtypes, which in turn can be analyzed for the expression of novel molecular markers neuronal cell types (e.g. from single cell RNA-sequencing).  Finally, we will disseminate the data to the Brain Cell Data Center (BCDC) for data integration with those from other BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and for data access by the broader neuroscience research community.

cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	zeng_anderson_sc_10xv2_proj			10x 3' v2 sequencing	Transcriptomic cell types of ventromedial hypothalamus in the mouse: 10x cells	The ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) contains ~4,000 neurons that project to multiple targets and control innate social behaviors including aggression and mounting. However, the number of cell types in VMHvl and their relationship to connectivity and behavioral function are unknown. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing using two independent platforms-SMART-seq(~4,500 neurons) and 10x (~78,000 neurons)-and investigated correspondence between transcriptomic identity and axonal projections (Retro-seq for SMART-seq) or behavioral activation (Act-seq for 10x), respectively. Canonical correlation analysis identified 17 transcriptomic types (T-types), including several sexually dimorphic clusters, the majority of which were validated by seqFISH. Immediate early gene analysis from our Act-seq dataset identified T-types exhibiting preferential responses to intruder males versus females but only rare examples of behavior-specific activation.

Statement about this dataset: Transgenic or viral strategies were used to sparsely label specific neuron populations in the brain with fluorescent reporters. For whole-brain imaging, the intact brain was embedded in glycol methacrylate resin. By using the fMOST technology, each embedded brain can be imaged with 1 micron voxel. This complete strategy can acquire a three-dimensional image set that can identify dendritic, axons, and their terminals across the whole mouse brain. Scope of this dataset: The dataset will survey full neuronal morphologies of representative cell types in the whole brain regions.

cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	zeng_retro_proj			Retrograde trans-synaptic	Retrograde trans-synaptic imaging	Neuronal classification and connectivity have been the key point to understand brain. Single cell full morphology provides precise information for projection, correlation between dendrite and axon topology and functions. However, how to produce large-scale 3D full morphology is a major challenge. We developed a strict leveled protocol combined with automatic and manual procedures to systematically guide the neuron reconstruction process with clear standards. We reconstructed more than 1000 neurons located in thalamus, striatum, claustrum, etc. based on our protocol. Reconstructions of thalamus are grouped to sensory relay nuclei like VP, LGN, MG, VL etc. and higher order nuclei like PO, RT, etc. Strikingly, multiple axon clusters of single neuron present layer specific projections and highlights the projection which have been overlooked in population level, like VPM projecting to secondary sensory cortex. Axonal branching patterns are with different characteristics from different nuclei, like Neurons located in Reticular nucleus display netting pattern. Importantly, soma location, dendritic structure and axonal projection could be tightly correlated for specific neurons like neurons located nearby border of PO and VPM. Also, single cell could supply more accurate intracellular connectivity compared to population level.

Transgenic or viral strategies were used to label specific cell populations in the brain with fluorescent reporters. Sample collection was biased to enable sampling of as many cell types as possible and reduce redundant cell type collection. Most of the cells in this dataset were collected using broad Cre-driver lines that labeled all neurons (Snap25-IRES2-Cre), all Glutamatergic cells (Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre), or all GABAergic cells (Slc32a1-IRES-Cre or Gad2-IRES-Cre).

Fine dissections of brain regions and cortical layers were performed and tracked throughout sample processing. Specimens were dissected from both hemispheres in both male and female mice. Fluorescence activated s+J10orting of cells was performed based on expression or absence of fluorescent reporter labels to isolate individual cells into separate tubes.

Coarse dissections of brain regions were performed and specimens were dissected from both hemispheres of male and female mice.

This method enables a rapid, large-scale survey of cell types in brain regions with accurate recovery of cell type proportions, but at low gene coverage per nucleus.

cfde_id_namespace_id:BCDC	fischl_oct_proj			OCT	Serial sectioning block-face polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography of ex vivo human brain blocks	Volumetric OCT data collected from ex vivo human brain area BA 44/45 after index matching with 60% v/v TDE. Serial sectioning was performed with a slice thickness of 500 um. Block-face OCT acquisition was performed with a 4x objective with 5 um isotropic resolution. Each image tile has FOV of 3x3 mm2 and was stitched with adjacent image tiles during post-processing. The focal plane depth was shifted three times for each slice to cover the whole thickness of the 500um slice.
